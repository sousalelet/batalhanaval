# batalhanaval
This is a simple Battleship game implemented in Python. The game generates a 4x4 grid where a hidden ship is randomly placed. The player has four attempts to guess its location by inputting row and column values.

-> If the guess matches the ship's location, the player wins.
-> If the guess is out of bounds or repeated, an appropriate message is displayed.
-> Incorrect guesses are marked with an "X" on the grid.

This project is a basic introduction to loops, conditionals, and random number generation in Python.
